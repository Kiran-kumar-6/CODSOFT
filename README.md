Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers, including their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as their age, gender, and class. We will use a Logistic Regression model to make these predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset. It can be downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Passenger gender
Age: Passenger age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Exploratory Data Analysis
We begin by loading the dataset and exploring the data to understand its structure and contents. This involves displaying the first few rows, checking for missing values, and visualizing the distribution of key features.

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.read_csv("Titanic-Dataset.csv")
print(df.head())
print(df.shape)
print(df.describe())
print(df['Survived'].value_counts())

# Visualize survival count with respect to passenger class
sns.countplot(x=df['Survived'], hue=df['Pclass'])
plt.show()

# Visualize survival count with respect to gender
sns.countplot(x=df['Sex'], hue=df['Survived'])
plt.show()
Preprocessing
Before training our model, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping unnecessary columns.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Encode 'Sex' column
labelencoder = LabelEncoder()
df['Sex'] = labelencoder.fit_transform(df['Sex'])

# Drop columns with too many missing values or not useful for prediction
df = df.drop(['Age', 'Cabin', 'Name', 'Ticket'], axis=1)

# Drop rows with missing values in the remaining columns
df = df.dropna()

print(df.isna().sum())
print(df.head())
Model Training
We split the data into training and testing sets and train a Logistic Regression model to predict survival.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X = df[['Pclass', 'Sex', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'Embarked']]
Y = df['Survived']

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

log = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
log.fit(X_train, Y_train)
Prediction
We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and evaluate the results.

python
Copy code
pred = log.predict(X_test)
print(pred)
print(Y_test)

# Example prediction
res = log.predict([[2, 1, 0, 0, 20.0, 1]])
if res == 0:
    print("So Sorry! Not Survived")
else:
    print("Survived")
Conclusion
In this project, we built a machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers. The model was trained using logistic regression and evaluated on a test set. Further improvements can be made by including additional features and using more advanced machine learning algorithms.
